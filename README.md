# Bone Marrow Transplant Survival Prediction  

## Overview  
This project aims to predict the one-year survival status of pediatric patients undergoing Bone Marrow Transplants (BMTs). Using machine learning models and feature engineering, the goal is to identify key factors affecting survival and develop a predictive model that assists doctors in decision-making.  

## Features  
- Preprocessing of imbalanced and missing data.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to highlight significant trends and correlations.  
- Model training and evaluation with an emphasis on F2-score for imbalanced data.  
- Parameter tuning for optimal model performance.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
This project was developed using Python 3.0.10. Ensure you have the correct Python version installed before proceeding.
